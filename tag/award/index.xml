      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;DevOps Gurus&amp;rdquo; team achieved a remarkable accomplishment by securing the 2nd position in the DevOps category at the Buet Cse Fest 2022 Hackathon. The team members, Mohibul Alam, Syed Yusuf Ahmed and Mahdee Hasan, demonstrated excellent skills and worked tirelessly for 24 hours to solve all the challenges presented to them during the competition. The team enjoyed the overnight competition and gained valuable experience and knowledge. The team&amp;rsquo;s achievement was recognized by Dr. Mohammad Kaykobad, who presented them with the prize. Unfortunately, Yusuf was unable to attend the prize-giving ceremony. The team used various technologies and tools to build their project, including Angular for frontend, Node js for backend, Docker and Docker Hub for containerization, Kubernetes for orchestration, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for infrastructure, Terraform and Github for infrastructure provision, Grafana and Promethus for infrastructure monitoring, Github Actions for CI/CD pipeline, and Hugo for documentation. The team expresses their gratitude to Rafed Muhammad Yasir for his guidance and continuous support, and they hope to become future champions in upcoming competitions.&lt;/p&gt;
